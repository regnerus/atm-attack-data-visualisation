% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}

  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart


Voice is the main form of human communication. Vocal communication and it's role is essential in all areas of life, both in a professional as well as in personal life. Humans use vocal communication for, amongst other things, expressing feelings, the transmission of knowledge and other day to day social interactions. Speech encodes both linguistic intent as well as paralinguistic information such as emotion, age and gender. \cite{c1}

People suffering from certain medical diseases can have great difficulty with using vocal communication. Often this difficulty is associated with respiratory, nasal, neural and larynx diseases. Therefore the study of Paralinguistics in vocal disorders have become an important medical procedure.

Paralinguistics, communicative vocal aspects that are typically not linguistic, contains extralinguistic- and paralinguistic. Extralinguistic features can be physical aspects such as age, gender or physical stress or mental aspects such as a depression. Paralinguistic features can be a broad range of affective states, feelings or emotions. \cite{c3}

This research proposal will explore the possibilities of developing a system for automatic disease detection using paralinguistic features.

\section{Background and Related Work} \label{research}
Related work has focused on the diagnosis of characteristic irregularities in voice patterns of patients with certain medical conditions. These features in voice patterns should form the basis for a system that tries to do an automatic detection and classification of medical diseases. Some research in the field of medical diseases and conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) will be discussed in this section. Research which has been conducted on the diagnosis using linguistic or text-based features will not be discussed.

\subsection{Autism Spectrum Disorders}
Autism is a group of mental disorders, collectively called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An individual with an autism spectrum disorder can have a wide range of symptoms that can result in many impairments such as social interaction, behavioural and communication skills. \cite{c4}
Hoque et. al. have shown that individuals with an autism spectrum disorder produce speech with either high or low speech rate, and atypical pitch and/or amplitude affect (prosodic aspects). \cite{c5}

\subsection{Alzheimer’s disease}
Alzheimer’s disease is a common form of dementia. Common symptoms are: memory loss, confusion, irritability, aggression, trouble with language, and mood swings. While there is no known cure for this form of dementia, its effects can be delayed if therapy starts early. \cite{c6} Appell et. al. have proven that dementia and specifically Alzheimer’s disease affect human speech. \cite{c7} Satt et. al. describe an automatic classification technique using different focal features to classify different stages of Alzheimer's disease. Their research provides a classification accuracy of 87\% for the classification between the control group and patients with Alzheimer's disease, providing evidence for potential use for automatic detection of very early dementia. \cite{c8}

In addition research by Weiner et. al. on speech-based detection of Alzheimer’s disease in conversational German shows a classification accuracy similar to the classification conducted by Satt et. al. in the English language. \cite{c9} 

\subsection{Parkinson's disease}
Parkinson's disease is a chronic and progressive movement disorder. The cause is unknown, and although there is presently no cure, there are treatment options such as medication and surgery to manage its symptoms. \cite{c10} Parkinson’s disease is strongly associated with voice changes. One of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, tremor, is also apparent in an individual's voice. Voice tremor is linked to frequency/pitch and amplitude/loudness perturbation. \cite{c11}

Research by Villa-Can ̃as et. al. explore a method for automatic detection of Parkinson’s disease using a joint acoustic and modulation frequency representation. Their classification one by means of a Gaussian mixture model, shows that the approach can classify individuals between a control group and with Parkinson's disease with an accuracy of around 71\%. \cite{c12}


\section{Problem Statement and Motivation}
For the medical diseases and conditions that were described, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), it is important that diagnosis of these diseases can happen as soon as possible. As an illustration: in the case of Alzheimer’s it is estimated that about half of individuals suffering from the disease have not been diagnosed. \cite{c13} Furthermore the Alzheimer's association reports numerous benefits of an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to help affected individuals and their families. \cite{c14}

A few problems however arise that in many cases prevent the early diagnosis of the described medical diseases and conditions. In many cases a large group of individuals would have to be examined at regular intervals for certain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Research for these diseases  and conditions would not only be costly but would also require a large amount of time for medical professionals and other caretakers which are conducting all these examinations.

If research would indicate that an automatic disease detection system could accurately classify certain medical diseases and conditions it could be used as a system for an accurate pre-examination, therefore vastly decreasing the amount of examinations which have to be conducted by the medical professionals and other caretakers therefore reducing their workload and the overall costs of these examinations. 


\section{Research Questions} \label{questions}
The problem statement and motivation lead to the following research questions:

\textit{How can diagnosed paralinguistic features in speech be used to create automatic disease classification systems?}

This question is answered with the support of the following questions:  

\begin{itemize}
\item Is accurate disease detection merely based on paralinguistic features possible?
\item What are sensible features that could be used in the automatic classification of a certain disease?
\item How do such classification systems behave across different languages?
\end{itemize}

\section{Method} \label{method}
To give an accurate answer the above mentioned research questions multiple different tasks have to be conducted. 

One could argue if it is feasible to focus on all of the above mentioned medical diseases and conditions or if further research should narrow down on to one specific disease and merely focus on that disease. If it is decided to focus on one disease also the choice of this disease is important, a research study could be conducted to find the medical diseases or condition that has to most potential for an automatic disease detection system. Personal motivation could also play a role in the choice to choose a disease or condition to focus on for further research.

Furthermore an extensive literature study has to be conducted to establish a list of features which could used for the classification of a disease or condition. Already some research in the field of medical diseases and conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been mentioned in section \ref{research}. Literature research could further expand into different diseases that have been linked to affect human speech. Furthermore based on the literature research, a table should be constructed with different paralinguistic- and linguistic features and their success in accurately classifying diseases. Such a table could help answer the question if it is possible to classify a certain disease merely based on paralinguistic features or if also linguistic features are needed in this case. 

After conducting an extensive literature study, selecting a disease or diseases to focus further research on and selecting fitting (para)linguistic features an automatic system could be created for the detection and classification. Different feature extraction, such as PCA or Mel-frequency cepstrum, and classification techniques will have to be examined and evaluated. 

Finally accuracy of such a system should be evaluated preferably across different languages to get a good understanding of the effects that different, languages, accents or cultural differences can have on such a classification system.



\section{Scientific and social impact} \label{impact}
Research on the automatic disease detection using paralinguistic feature could have valuable impact both scientific and socially.

Scientifically a literature review across multiple conducted research could provide valuable insight in different paralinguistic- and linguistic features and their success in accurately classifying diseases. Furthermore research in feature extraction and classification techniques could help future research on similar scientific problems.

Socially, if research would indicate that an automatic disease detection system could accurately classify certain medical diseases and conditions, a disease detection system could have a large impact. As has been stated in section \ref{impact}, quality of life of patients could be drastically improved by an earlier diagnosis of some diseases. Furthermore the workload of medical professionals and other caretakers could be reduced as well as the overall costs associated with these diagnosis.
